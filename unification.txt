% testing the Unification
?- unify(a, a).              % Should succeed (true)
?- unify(X, a).              % Should succeed (X is unified with a)
?- unify(a, X).              % Should succeed (a is unified with X)
?- unify(X, Y).              % Should succeed (X and Y can be any term)
?- unify(a, b).              % Should fail (different atoms)
